The hashcat plays an especially important role in single-client rOpenCL testing, as it is the only test with the ability to use more than one GPU, allowing you to fully explore the 4 GPUs in the test environment and realize not only the overload of remote execution, as well as its effect on scalability.

Note that the hashcat has an integrated benchmark feature (a brute force attack on a single hash ). However, it involves very few data transfers between the host and the GPUs, as the hash space is known a priori and divided equally among the GPUs used. As an alternative, we used an * example that uses a dictionary with rules to break 28 passwords encrypted with the MD5 cipher, the scenarios tested are those presented in Table 0, involving different combinations of local and remote GPUs, as permitted by the test environment (see table 1 and 2) at the date.

The tests were run with a two servers (rDaemon) and a single client ( rOpenCL driver).  The client submitted requests  for 4 GPUs.
